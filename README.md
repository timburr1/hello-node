# hello-node
Hello world web-server, using Node.js

The node_modules folder is already included, to get around firewall issues. To run the project open a terminal, navigate to the project root, and run 
```
$ npm run start 
```

Unfortunately, opening a terminal on your school laptop is tricky. You'll need to open the File Explorer and navigate to C:\Windows\System32. Copy + paste cmd.exe to your Desktop, right-click the new icon, and edit with Notepad++. It doesn't really matter what, but you need to change *something* on line 1. So for example, "This Program cannot be run in DOS mode." -> "Th1s Program..." 

Once that is saved, you should be able to bring up a new command prompt by double-clicking the new icon on your Desktop.
